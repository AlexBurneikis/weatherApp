# Weather app
Very simple weather app to get current weather information from any city you know.

This app was made with the purpose of learning how to use an API with all their caveats like promises, asynchronous functions, hiding the APIKEY and not showing it on the front end.

The most challenging part for me was the backEnd server to hide the API key and query the cities from there, I needed a lot of NPM packages like express or dotenv that I did not know how to use, but I learned the basics of them to do what I needed to do.
